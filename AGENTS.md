# Repository instructions

These instructions apply repository-wide.

## Objective

- The final goal is to prove that the shipped Zesu `zesu_decode_raw` implementation conforms to the
  pinned Ethereum SSZ specification. State how local proof or tooling work advances that goal.
- Preserve useful earlier work, but do not retain a theorem, contract, or abstraction merely because
  it already exists. Reject or replace statements whose machine assumptions are false.

## Proof navigation

- `root_compliance` is the single public entry theorem for the compliance proof. Reserve the `root_`
  prefix for it: no theorem or definition in its transitive dependency tree may begin with `root_`.
  A reader searching for `root_compliance` must immediately find the unique top of the proof tree.
- Every conditional refinement level must expose a named edge that converts that level's assumptions
  into its parent's assumptions. The parent theorem must call that edge explicitly; do not leave the
  composition implicit in a bundle of hypotheses.
- Name refinement edges for the direction they establish, such as `exportedContracts_of_level1`.
  Keep logical premises distinct from bytecode-coverage obligations retained for later runtime proofs.

## Refinement strategy

- Work top-down from the exported program: state a conditional theorem over its immediate machine
  regions, prove the small regions, and further resolve only the large regions.
- Treat each resolution depth as a reviewable stacked change. Do not introduce a flat catalog of all
  discovered functions as though it were the proof architecture.
- Contracts describe actual optimized machine-code boundaries. Inlined source functions do not obey
  a source-level RISC-V function ABI; apply ABI assumptions only at genuine calls.
- Bind every semantic or ghost value used by a contract to registers or memory at that boundary.

## Contract admission

- Before investing in a proof, require three checks: structural correspondence to the production ELF,
  semantic review against source/specification, and empirical tests for every measurable clause.
- Use the production ELF for machine observations and an independently built source probe as an
  oracle. Add focused negative or mutation tests showing that each checker rejects relevant faults.
- Evidence guides admission but is not a proof. Record unmeasured clauses and failures explicitly.
- Use generated, source-derived Lean identifiers for function instances. Do not select proof objects
  through numeric catalog positions or string names.

## Compiler evidence

- Prefer LLVM outputs as the common source for symbols, call structure, inlining, and interfaces.
  Use disassembly and generated control-flow regions to check the final machine code.
- DWARF augments LLVM evidence with source identity and locations; it does not override instructions in
  the shipped binary.

## Loops

- Prove loops with an invariant or recursive theorem plus a decreasing measure or justified bound.
  Do not unroll a loop merely because observed test inputs make it short; runtime-dependent lengths are
  compatible with an inductive proof.

## Verification

- Use focused Lean targets and evidence tests while iterating. Run the full `lake build` at coherent
  checkpoints, before committing proof changes, and before claiming a completed chunk.
- Regenerate compiler-derived artifacts from the current branch. Shared worktree build artifacts may
  accelerate compilation, but stale generated inputs or `.olean` files are not evidence.
